            This diff shows **chart template changes** between main and this PR, both rendered with the **current** [`minimal.yaml`](../blob/${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}/charts/immich/examples/minimal.yaml) configuration.

            This isolates changes to the chart itself. For example-specific diffs, see the individual example comments below.
